# My system info
Running node 5.4.2   (I had to upgrade the default one shipped iwth ubuntu 16.04 which was OLD)

# Other requirements
mongo should be installed on the local system

## Ubuntu 16.04 Node Instructions
The version of node that shits with default Ubuntu 16.04 is quite old  (mine had 3.5.2)

I have tested this applicatuin using node 4.1.2, and this is how I did the pm2 server as well (which was using 2.7.2)

```
cd ~    
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x -o nodesource_setup.sh    
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh    
```
# Install mongo onto my machine
```
